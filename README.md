# Automated_credit_decision_system

The goal of this project is to assist Banks/NBFC in the process of credit decision (i.e whether an application is approved or rejected) by working as a pre-filter for processing hundreds or thousands of applications received everyday.

I have used [PKDD'99](https://relational.fit.cvut.cz/dataset/Financial) Financial Dataset which is a real anonymized Czech Republic Bank transcations, account info, card info , loan records etc in relational database format.
