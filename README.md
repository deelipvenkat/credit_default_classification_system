# Automated_credit_decision_system

The goal of this project is to assist Banks/NBFC in the process of credit decision (i.e whether an application is approved or rejected) by working as a pre-filter for processing hundreds or thousands of applications received everyday so that the manual loan approval processes high quality loans. Also the number of features which a machine learning model considers might be impossible for a human to consider.


ABOUT THE DATASET
I have used [PKDD'99](https://relational.fit.cvut.cz/dataset/Financial) Financial Dataset which is a real anonymized Czech Republic Bank data in relational database format.The bank has provided data about their clients, the accounts (transactions within several months), the loans already granted, the credit cards issued etc.
